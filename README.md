## Introduction
Android Bike Tracker is a Android application used as a head on display while user is biking. This application integrates ant+ wireless technology that tracks accurate bike speed and cadence.

This project is still on-going and expect to release beta in 2016.


## ANT+ SDK
This application relies heavily on Ant+ SDK. It does take a while to understand how ANT+ sensors talk to android devices.
Here is the link to their developer web page.
